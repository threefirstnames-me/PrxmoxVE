To work with GPG keys, especially for signing commits on GitHub, it's important to follow best practices for both security and usability. Let's start with generating a GPG key, and then we can handle email and commit configuration.

### Step 1: Generate a GPG Key
1. **Install GPG** (if it's not already installed):
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install gnupg
   ```
2. **Generate a GPG Key Pair**:
   Run the following command to generate a new key:
   ```bash
   gpg --full-generate-key
   ```
   - Choose RSA and RSA for the key type.
   - Use a key size of 4096 bits for better security.
   - Set an appropriate expiration date if you want.
   - When prompted for an email, you can use a unique email or leave it empty for more privacy.
   - Set a strong passphrase for the key.

3. **List Your GPG Keys**:
   ```bash
   gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
   ```
   You'll see something like:
   ```
   /home/username/.gnupg/secring.gpg
   --------------------------------
   sec   rsa4096/KEYID 2024-11-14 [expires: 2026-11-14]
         1234567890ABCDEF1234567890ABCDEF12345678
   uid           [ultimate] Your Name <your-email@example.com>
   ssb   rsa4096/12345678 2024-11-14
   ```
   Copy the `KEYID` value, which is the part after `rsa4096/`.

4. **Add the GPG Key to GitHub**:
   Export your GPG public key:
   ```bash
   gpg --armor --export KEYID
   ```
   Copy the output and add it to your GitHub account under **Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New GPG key**.

### Step 2: Configure Git to Use GPG
To configure Git to sign commits with your GPG key by default, run:
```bash
git config --global user.signingkey KEYID
git config --global commit.gpgSign true
```

### Step 3: Handling Emails for Commits
If your Debian machine's email address is not the one registered with GitHub, you have a couple of options:

1. **Use GitHub's No-Reply Email**:
   To avoid sharing your personal email, you can use GitHub's no-reply email address. In GitHub settings, enable "Keep my email address private." This will provide a no-reply address in the format:
   ```
   your-username@users.noreply.github.com
   ```
   Then configure Git to use that address:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.email "your-username@users.noreply.github.com"
   ```

2. **Create a Separate Git Account on the Debian Machine**:
   If you'd rather keep things separated, you could create a new Git identity for the Debian machine:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Commit Name"
   git config --global user.email "your-debian-specific-email@example.com"
   ```
   This way, you can still sign commits and push them to GitHub, even if the email is different from your main account.

### Step 4: Signing Commits
When you commit code, use:
```bash
git commit -S -m "Your commit message"
```
The `-S` flag ensures your commit is signed with your GPG key.

### Should You Erase the Email on the Debian Machine?
You can use the no-reply email or configure a separate commit identity for privacy. Deleting the email on your Debian machine will make unsigned commits, which may not be ideal if you want to maintain a good security posture. GitHub also marks unsigned commits, which could make them seem less trustworthy to others. Having a separate commit account with a no-reply email or unique email for that machine is the better option.
